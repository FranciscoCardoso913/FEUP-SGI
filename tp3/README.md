### Scene

A recreation of Kratos' house in its Nordic setting, including key elements like the central hearth, wooden pillars, and beds for Kratos and Atreus.
We have also included a table with a newspaper and a candle, which adds to the overall ambiance of the scene.
The whole building is based in the original game, with special attention to the size and proportions of the elements.
There is a official video behind the beds where Kratos is dancing with his son, Atreus, and a paint with the implemented mipmapping.
Finally, with the open roof and windows, we can see the snowy terrain outside the house.
